// 🟧 Challenge: Color Box
// As a developer, you are tasked with creating a color box application. The application will allow the user to click a box and see a different color with every click.

// 📚 User Stories
// As a user, I can see a square box on the screen with a black border and a white background 
// DONE
// As a user, I can see the default color name "white" inside the box
// DONE 
// As a user, every time I click on the box the name of a different color appears
// Possible color names: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink
// As a user, every time I click the box instead of the color name, I see the background color in the box change to represent the color.
// As a user, I can see many boxes on the page all acting independently of one another.
// 🏔 Stretch Goals
// As a user, I can start with no boxes on the screen
// As a user, I can see a button to add a box
// As a user, I can see a button to remove a box
// As a user, every time I click the add button, I can add an additional box that acts independently of the other boxes
// As a user, every time I click the remove button, I can remove the last box in the series
